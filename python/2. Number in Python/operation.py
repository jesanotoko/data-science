#Integer Variables
x = 5 # x value is 5 
y = 10 # y value is 10
z = 0 # z value is 0

#Basic arithmetic operations
addition = x + y # x value + y value      5+10 = 15 (15 is stored in addition)
print(addition)  # when we print additon then we see the value of addition
subtraction = x - y # 5-10 = -5
print(subtraction) # subtraction = -5
multiplication = x * y # 5*10 = 50
division = x/y  # it gives us float number
exponentiation = x ** 2 # x squared or x to the power of 2
remainder = x % 5
fraction = 17 // 3 # floor division discards the fractional part
print(fraction)
x = 5 * (4+4) * 7 # Firstly calculate the bracket number
result = 2 + 3 * 4 / 2 - 1 # `3 * 4`` evaluted first(multiplication), `12/2` is evaluted next(Division), next `2 + 6 - 1`is evaluted(addition and subtraction), finally `7` is assigned to the variable
